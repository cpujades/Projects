# Convolutional Neural Networks

## Project: Write an Algorithm for Landmark Classification

### A simple app

In this notebook we build a very simple app that uses our exported model.

> <img src="static_images/icons/noun-info-2558213.png" alt="?" style="width:25px"/> Note how we are not importing anything from our source code (we do not use any module from the ``src`` directory). This is because the exported model, differently from the model weights, is a standalone serialization of our model and therefore it does not need anything else. You can ship that file to anybody, and as long as they can import ``torch``, they will be able to use your model. This is very important for releasing pytorch models to production.

### Test your app
Go to a search engine for images (like Google Images) and search for images of some of the landmarks, like the Eiffel Tower, the Golden Gate Bridge, Machu Picchu and so on. Save a few examples locally, then upload them to your app to see how your model behaves!

The app will show the top 5 classes that the model think are most relevant for the picture you have uploaded


```python
from ipywidgets import VBox, Button, FileUpload, Output, Label
from PIL import Image
from IPython.display import display
import io
import numpy as np
import torchvision
import torchvision.transforms as T
import torch

# Decide which model you want to use among the ones exported
learn_inf = torch.jit.load("checkpoints/original_exported.pt")

def on_click_classify(change):

    # Load image that has been uploaded
    img = Image.open(io.BytesIO(btn_upload.value[-1].content))

    img.load()

    # Let's clear the previous output (if any)
    out_pl.clear_output()

    # Display the image
    with out_pl:

        ratio = img.size[0] / img.size[1]
        c = img.copy()
        c.thumbnail([ratio * 200, 200])
        display(c)

    # Transform to tensor
    timg = T.ToTensor()(img).unsqueeze_(0)

    # Calling the model
    softmax = learn_inf(timg).data.cpu().numpy().squeeze()
    
    # Get the indexes of the classes ordered by softmax
    # (larger first)
    idxs = np.argsort(softmax)[::-1]
    
    # Loop over the classes with the largest softmax
    for i in range(5):
        # Get softmax value
        p = softmax[idxs[i]]
    
        # Get class name
        landmark_name = learn_inf.class_names[idxs[i]]
        
        labels[i].value = f"{landmark_name} (prob: {p:.2f})"


# Putting back btn_upload to a widget for next cell
btn_upload = FileUpload()

btn_run = Button(description="Classify")
btn_run.on_click(on_click_classify)

labels = []
for _ in range(5):
    labels.append(Label())

out_pl = Output()
out_pl.clear_output()

wgs = [Label("Please upload a picture of a landmark"), btn_upload, btn_run, out_pl]
wgs.extend(labels)

VBox(wgs)
```




    VBox(children=(Label(value='Please upload a picture of a landmark'), FileUpload(value=(), description='Upload'â€¦



## (optional) Standalone app or web app

You can run this notebook as a standalone app on your computer by following these steps:

1. Download this notebook in a directory on your machine
2. Download the model export (for example, ``checkpoints/transfer_exported.pt``) in a subdirectory called ``checkpoints`` within the directory where you save the app.ipynb notebook
3. Install voila if you don't have it already (``pip install voila``)
4. Run your app: ``voila app.ipynb --show_tracebacks=True``
5. Customize your notebook to make your app prettier and rerun voila

You can also deploy this app as a website using Binder: https://voila.readthedocs.io/en/stable/deploy.html#deployment-on-binder
